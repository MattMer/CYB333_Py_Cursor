# CYB333 – Security Automation Projects

This repository contains all coding tasks, labs, and automation projects completed for **CYB333: Security Automation**. Each project demonstrates practical applications of Python, scripting, and security tooling to automate common defensive workflows. The goal of this repository is to document progress throughout the course and provide clear, reproducible examples of security automation in action.

## Purpose
This repository serves both as a portfolio of course work and as a reference for building practical automation skills. As the course progresses, new modules and improvements will be added to show iteration, experimentation, and refinement of security automation techniques.
