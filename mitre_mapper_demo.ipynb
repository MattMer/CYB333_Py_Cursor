    "# MITRE ATT&CK Mapper for Windows Security Events - Demo Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `mitre_mapper_windows.py` script to automatically map Windows Security Event Log entries to MITRE ATT&CK framework tactics and techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The MITRE ATT&CK Mapper is a security automation tool that:\n",
    "- Reads Windows Security event logs from the local system or CSV files\n",
    "- Automatically maps Event IDs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques using dynamic rules from the Sigma repository\n",
    "- Enriches events with threat intelligence context\n",
    "- Generates comprehensive security reports\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using This Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Automated Threat Intelligence Context**\n",
    "   - Automatically associates Windows events with known attack techniques\n",
    "   - Provides immediate context about what an event might indicate\n",
    "   - No need to manually look up Event IDs in documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Prioritization Through Severity Mapping**\n",
    "   - Events are automatically assigned severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational)\n",
    "   - Helps security analysts focus on the most important events first\n",
    "   - Enables automated triage workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Standardized Threat Framework Alignment**\n",
    "   - Maps events to the industry-standard MITRE ATT&CK framework\n",
    "   - Enables consistent threat reporting and communication\n",
    "   - Facilitates threat hunting and detection engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Dynamic Rule Updates**\n",
    "   - Automatically fetches the latest detection rules from the Sigma repository\n",
    "   - Stays current with emerging threats and detection techniques\n",
    "   - Caches rules locally for offline operation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Comprehensive Event Enrichment**\n",
    "   - Adds tactic information (Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, etc.)\n",
    "   - Includes technique descriptions and references\n",
    "   - Preserves original event data for full context\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Scalable Analysis**\n",
    "   - Processes large volumes of events efficiently\n",
    "   - Supports both real-time (Event Log) and batch (CSV) processing\n",
    "   - Generates structured reports for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through a practical example!"
